# Weather Application üå¶Ô∏è

This project is a weather application built using **React** and **TypeScript**, following the **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture. The app allows users to search for cities, view their current weather conditions, and filter results by temperature using live data fetched from the OpenWeather API.

## Introduction

The Weather Application provides a simple and interactive interface for users to check the current weather conditions of any city worldwide. This app uses **React** and **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and scalability, and follows the **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** methodology to keep the codebase modular and maintainable.

## Features

- Search for weather information by city name.
- View current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Filter results based on temperature range.
- Modular code structure following the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript for better code quality.
- **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)**: Architectural pattern for project organization.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped and modular styles.
- **OpenWeather API**: Source for real-time weather data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed on your machine.

- **Node.js**:Version 16.17.0 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenWeather API key:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_KEY = your_api_key_here
   REACT_APP_BASE_URL = https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
6. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of a city in the search bar.
2. Select from the suggestion options or click the Search button.
3. View the current weather conditions for the city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
4. Use the temperature filter to display cities within a specific temperature range.
5. Click the close button in the upper right corner of the card if you want to delete the city card.

## Testing and Coverage

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing. We aim for high test coverage to ensure the reliability and quality of the application. Currently, the project maintains **over 80% test coverage** across all components and functions.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

    npm test
    # or
    yarn test

### Test Coverage Report

To generate a test coverage report, run:

    npm test:coverage
    # or
    yarn test:coverage

The coverage report will be output to the /coverage directory. Open the index.html file in a browser to view the detailed coverage report. **You should see that the coverage is maintained at over 80%**.
